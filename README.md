## MITOS_LOD - CPSV-AP Transformation

**Overview**

This project aims to publish MITOS public service descriptions as Linked Open Data (LOD) using CPSV-AP. The process involves transforming data from MITOS, the Greek National Registry of Administrative Procedures, into LOD compliant with CPSV-AP, the Core Public Service Vocabulary Application Profile. This transformation enhances the interoperability and integration of public service data.

**Project Structure**

*   `asyncMain.py`: Handles asynchronous retrieval of public service descriptions from the MITOS API.
*   `generated_data.ttl`: Stores the generated LOD data in Turtle syntax (RDF).
*   `mitos-transformation-dag.py`: Defines the Apache Airflow Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) for orchestrating the data transformation pipeline.
*   `processorMain.py`: Processes, structures, and stores the retrieved public service descriptions in CSV files, organized by CPSV-AP classes.
*   `upload.py`: Manages the upload of the transformed LOD data to OpenLink Virtuoso.

**Dependencies**

*   Python 3.x
*   Apache Airflow
*   OpenLink Virtuoso
*   MITOS API Access

**Setup and Execution**

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/BDTI-Mitos-LOD/cpsv-ap-transformation.git
    ```
    
2.  **Configure Airflow:**
    
    *   Set up an Airflow environment.
    *   Import the `mitos-transformation-dag.py` DAG into Airflow.
    *   Configure necessary Airflow connections (e.g., MITOS API, Virtuoso).
    
3.  **Run the Airflow DAG:**
    
    *   Trigger the DAG from the Airflow UI.
    *   The DAG will orchestrate the data retrieval, transformation, and upload to Virtuoso.
    

**Key Concepts**

*   **MITOS**: The Greek National Registry of Administrative Procedures.
*   **CPSV-AP**: Core Public Service Vocabulary Application Profile, a standard for describing public services as LOD.
*   **LOD**: Linked Open Data, an approach for publishing and connecting structured data on the web.
*   **Apache Airflow**: A platform for programmatically authoring, scheduling, and monitoring workflows.
*   **OpenLink Virtuoso**: An RDF triple store and SPARQL endpoint for storing and querying LOD.

**Usage Scenarios**

*   **Improved Public Service Discoverability**: Citizens and businesses can easily find and understand available public services.
*   **Personalized Recommendations**: Service providers can offer targeted public service suggestions based on user needs.
*   **Policy Analysis**: Policymakers can evaluate the impact of public service changes.
*   **Transparency**: Public service information is openly accessible, promoting accountability.
*   **Performance Tracking**: Organizations can monitor and improve public service delivery.
*   **Value-added Services**: New applications and services can be developed using the LOD dataset.

**Future Work**

*   Linking MITOS linked data with other LOD cloud data.
*   Creating user-friendly visualization tools for the LOD data.
*   Optimizing the LOD update process for efficiency.
